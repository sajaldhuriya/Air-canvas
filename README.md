# Air Canvas

Air Canvas is an interactive drawing application that utilizes hand gestures for drawing on the screen. It is built using Flask for the web framework, OpenCV for image processing, and MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition. This project provides a novel way to draw in the air and control brush features such as thickness and color.

## Features
- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand movements in real-time.
- **Dynamic Drawing Interface:** Draw on the screen with different brush sizes and colors.
- **Flask Web Application:** Runs as a web-based app, making it easy to integrate with different devices.
